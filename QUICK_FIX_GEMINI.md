# ✅ GEMINI API KEY - FIXED!

## What Was Wrong?
The API route was looking for `GEMINI_API_KEY` but your `.env.local` only had `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`.

## What I Fixed?
Added `GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyCkMdMma1mTFJjZqiHzEppTzfSohCdY_IE` to your `.env.local` file.

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### 1. Restart Your Development Server
**IMPORTANT:** Environment variables are loaded when the server starts.

Stop your current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running `npm run dev`) and restart it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the AI Image Analysis

1. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000/ai-image
2. Upload a disaster image (any image of flood, fire, damage, etc.)
3. Click **"Analyze"**
4. You should see AI analysis within 2-5 seconds!

### 3. Verify It's Working

**Success indicators:**
- ✅ No "API key not configured" error
- ✅ Analysis appears after 2-5 seconds
- ✅ AI provides detailed disaster guidance

**If still not working:**
- Make sure you stopped and restarted the dev server
- Check the browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify the API key in `.env.local` is correct
