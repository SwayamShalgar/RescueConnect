# üöÄ Vercel Deployment Fix

## Date: October 6, 2025

---

## Problem

Vercel deployment was failing with the following error:

```
npm error code 1
npm error path /vercel/path0/node_modules/wrtc
npm error command failed
npm error command sh -c node scripts/download-prebuilt.js
npm error /bin/sh: line 1: node-pre-gyp: command not found
Error: Command "npm install" exited with 1
```

---

## Root Cause

The `wrtc` (WebRTC) package was listed as a dependency in `package.json`. This package:

1. **Has native dependencies** that require compilation
2. **Uses node-pre-gyp** for building native modules
3. **Fails on Vercel's build environment** due to missing build tools
4. **Is NOT needed** for our application

### Why wrtc was unnecessary:

- We use **PeerJS** for video chat, which handles WebRTC in the browser
- `wrtc` is for **server-side WebRTC**, which we don't use
- PeerJS works entirely client-side (browser WebRTC)
- No server-side peer connection management needed

---

## Solution

### 1. Removed wrtc from package.json

**Before:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-icons": "^5.5.0",
    "react-leaflet": "^5.0.0",
    "twilio": "^5.7.0",
    "wrtc": "^0.4.7",
    "ws": "^8.18.2"
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-icons": "^5.5.0",
    "react-leaflet": "^5.0.0",
    "twilio": "^5.7.0",
    "ws": "^8.18.2"
  }
}
```

### 2. Verified wrtc was not used in code

Searched the entire codebase:
- ‚úÖ No `require('wrtc')` found
- ‚úÖ No `import wrtc` found
- ‚úÖ No `from 'wrtc'` found
- ‚úÖ Safe to remove

### 3. Reinstalled dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Result: ‚úÖ Successful installation without errors

### 4. Tested production build

```bash
npm run build
```

Result: ‚úÖ Build completed successfully

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `package.json`
- **Change:** Removed `"wrtc": "^0.4.7"` from dependencies
- **Impact:** Cleaner dependency tree, faster installs, Vercel-compatible

### 2. `package-lock.json`
- **Change:** Automatically updated by npm to remove wrtc and its dependencies
- **Impact:** Locked versions updated

---

## Build Results

### Before Fix:
```
‚ùå npm error code 1
‚ùå npm error path /vercel/path0/node_modules/wrtc
‚ùå Error: Command "npm install" exited with 1
```

### After Fix:
```
‚úÖ added 261 packages, and audited 263 packages in 20s
‚úÖ Compiled successfully in 7.0s
‚úÖ Generating static pages (29/29)
‚úÖ Build completed successfully
```

---

## Deployment Steps

1. ‚úÖ Removed wrtc from package.json
2. ‚úÖ Reinstalled dependencies locally
3. ‚úÖ Tested production build locally
4. ‚úÖ Committed changes to git
5. ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub: `git push`
6. ‚è≥ Vercel will auto-deploy from GitHub

## Common Vercel Deployment Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Fails with Module Not Found
**Solution:** Check all import paths are correct
- Use relative paths from the file location
- Verify file extensions match (`.js`, `.jsx`)

### Issue 2: Environment Variables Not Working
**Solution:** 
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add all required variables
3. Redeploy after adding variables

### Issue 3: Database Connection Fails
**Solution:**
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in Vercel
2. Check if your database allows connections from Vercel's IPs
3. For Neon, enable "Allow connections from all IP addresses"

### Issue 4: API Routes Return 500
**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel Function Logs in dashboard
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check database connection string format

### Issue 5: Static Files Not Loading
**Solution:**
1. Place static files in `public/` folder
2. Reference as `/filename.ext` (not `./public/filename.ext`)
3. Verify files are committed to git

## Additional Fixes Applied

### Metadata Warnings Fixed
Also fixed Next.js 15 metadata warnings by separating `viewport` and `themeColor` into a separate export:

**Before (‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings):**
```javascript
export const metadata = {
  themeColor: "#2563eb",
  viewport: {
    width: "device-width",
    initialScale: 1,
  }
}
```

**After (‚úÖ No Warnings):**
```javascript
export const metadata = {
  title: "RescueConnect",
  description: "Emergency Response Platform"
}

export const viewport = {
  width: "device-width",
  initialScale: 1,
  themeColor: "#2563eb"
}
```
