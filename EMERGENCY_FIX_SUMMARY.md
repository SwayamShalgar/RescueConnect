# Emergency Button Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
❌ **Error**: `fetch failed` when clicking Emergency button  
❌ Email was sent but operation failed with fetch error

## Root Cause
The server-side API was trying to use `fetch()` to call another internal API route, which failed due to:
- URL resolution issues
- Server-to-server fetch problems
- Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` configuration

## Solution
✅ **Replaced fetch with direct database calls**
- Removed internal `fetch()` call to `/api/staff/alerts`
- Now queries volunteers directly from database
- Inserts alerts directly into database
- Wrapped in try-catch for graceful failure handling

## Changes Made

### Backend (`/api/staff/volunteersdashboard/route.js`):
```javascript
// REMOVED: fetch call to /api/staff/alerts
// ADDED: Direct SQL queries for nearby volunteers
// ADDED: Direct alert insertion into database
// ADDED: Better error handling with try-catch
```

### Frontend (`/src/app/volunteersdashboard/page.js`):
```javascript
// ADDED: JSON parsing error handling
// ADDED: Success flag checking
// ADDED: More specific error messages
```

## Result
✅ Emergency button now works without fetch errors  
✅ Government email sent successfully  
✅ Alerts saved to database  
✅ Nearby volunteers notified  
✅ Request deleted from database  
✅ Operation completes successfully

## Testing
1. Click Emergency button on accepted request
2. ✅ Should see success message
3. ✅ Request disappears from dashboard
4. ✅ No console errors
5. ✅ Government receives email
6. ✅ Alerts saved in database
